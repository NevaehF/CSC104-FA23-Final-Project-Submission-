          <!-- Suggestions -->
          <p> 
           - Take a Break, you deserve it! Step away from te caos. Sit in a quiet space and dabble in a calming activity.
          </p>
          <p> 
           - Listen to music tat calms you or meditation tapes (guided Meditation). 
          </p>
          <p>
           - Repeat words or suggestions in your mind that may help you relax and reduce muscle tension. For example,<br> you may imagine
            a peaceful setting. Then you can focus on relaxing your breathing, slowing your heart rate,<br>or feeling different physical
             sensations,such as relaxing each arm or leg one by one. 
          </p>
          <p>
          - Progressive muscle relaxation, you start by tensing and relaxing the muscles in your toes and<br> progressively working your way up to your neck and head. This is best done in 
           a quiet area without interruptions. <br>You can also start with your head and neck and work down to your toes. Tense
            your muscles for about five seconds and then<br> relax for 30 seconds, and repeat. 
        </p>
        <p>
          - Connect with friends and the community.
        </p>
        <p> 
          - Pick up new hobbies and healhty coping habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Sit comfortably with your back straight. Put one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.
          Breathe in through your nose.<br> The hand on your stomach should rise. The hand on your chest should move very little.
          Exhale through your mouth, pushing out<br> as much air as you can while contracting your abdominal muscles. The hand on your stomach should move in as you exhale, 
          but your<br> other hand should move very little. Continue to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to inhale enough so that your lower <br>abdomen 
          rises and falls. Count slowly as you exhale.
